Basic instructions are collected here to help you start with mbeddr.

Please, visit: http://mbeddr.fortiss.org/download/start/ for a newer version of instructions!

_Note: you set the installation directory, when the installer runs._


## First steps

#### How to start mbeddr?

mbeddr is used from within MPS. Run MPS first to use mbeddr.

In the installation directory you have the MPS set up for you. The installed
MPS instance has been preconfigured to use mbeddr. You can start it either
entering the MPS/bin directory and running _mps.sh_ script, or starting the MPS
app, clicking on its icon in Mac OS X. The app is in the installation
directory.


#### What to do next?

As a next step after the installation you could investigate the _tutorial_
project. It is located in the _code/applications_ folder in mbeddr.github
firectory. Alternatively, the Pacemaker or the HeartBleed examples could be of
your interest. Start MPS and open the project. Build languages first, to see
the models displayed correctly.


For more instructions on using MPS, please visit the
[JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) web site.

Check out the [mbeddr
userguide](https://github.com/qutorial/mbeddr_python_installer/blob/master
/mbeddr-userguide.pdf?raw=true) too. It is downloaded by the installer to the
installation directory.


## Uninstalling mbeddr

Just remove the installation directory.

## Troubleshooting

#### What to do if mbeddr projects do not open correctly?

Make sure that mbeddr has been built fully. Installer builds it after
downloading. You can rebuild mbeddr, by going to the
_mbeddr.github/code/languages_ folder and executing _buildLanguages_ script.
Additionally, after opening a project, build the languages contained in it.
